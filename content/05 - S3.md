# S3

S3 is effectively a _key/value_ store where the value is an object and an object is a file.

At a high-level:

- In our S3 account, you have your buckets.
- You can put objects (read: _files_) in your buckets.
- You can read from your buckets as well.
- You can host web pages out of your buckets.

A slightly lower, but still high level:

- Infinitely scalable.
- Files can be as small as zero bytes or as large as 5 terabytes.
- 99.9% availability (built for 99.99%).
- 99.999999999% durability.

S3 has a few different storage tiers:

- **Standard**—this is what we’ll be using today.
- **Standard-Infrequent Access**.
- **One Zone-Infrequent Access**.
- **Glacier Instant Retrieval**
- **Glacier Flexible Retrieval**
- **Glacier Deep Archive**
- **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**—I don't know, but I'll pay you to optimize this for me, AWS.

### Data consistency on S3

- Putting new objects in S3 is immediate. You’ll get back a 200 response.
- Updating and removing objects is eventually consistent. Users might get an old version. (This has literally never happened to me.)

### Costs

- Uploading to S3 is free.
- You get charged for storage.
- You get charged for requests. (We’ll learn how to mitigate this later.)
