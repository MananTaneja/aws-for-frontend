# The AWS free tier

- Let’s take a quick tour of the [free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).
- We’ll also set up billing notification warning us if we blow past the free tier.

For the first year, you get a bunch of stuff for free. It's a long list, but let's talk about a few of the ones that might be relevant for us as frontend engineers.

- **S3**: 5GB of storage.
- **Cloudfront**: 1TB of data transfer.
- **Lambda**: 1 million free requests per month.
- **Cognito**: 50,000 monthly active users.
- **AppSync**: 250,000 GraphQL data modifications per month.
- **Amazon Location Service**: 3 months of location data.
