I'm going to give you a few minutes to sign up for an account—mostly because I'm not super interested in live-streaming my phone number, credit card number, and home address.

You'll need to fill out a bunch of fun CAPTCHAs. You owe it to yourself to switch it into the mode where you have it read the numbers to you. It'll haunt you for months.

**Note**: You will need a credit card to sign up for an AWS account.
